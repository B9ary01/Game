### The Game Project 5 â€“ Bring it all together


1. Inspect the code.

2. Add game character controls [1 marks]
	
	- Check that your game character appears in your sketch

	- Test that your game character can move left and right and jump. NB. they won't fall back to
	the ground just yet.
	- Check that the animations look correct

3. Add falling code [1 marks]
	
	- Test that the character now falls back to the ground when you jump.

4. Render background items [2 marks]
	- From part 4_scrollingBackground, copy and paste the arrays `trees_x`, `clouds`, and `mountains`
	
	- Create three new functions `drawClouds`, `drawMountains`, `drawTrees`
	- Cut and paste each `for loop` into the relevant function.
	- In the `draw` function call each of the three new functions (eg. `drawClouds`)
	- You should now see all of the above items drawn to the screen

5. Render canyons and collectables [2 marks]
	- From 4_scrollingBackground, copy and paste the arrays `canyons`, `collectables`
	- We are also going to refactor this code but we will do things a little differently.
	- Now replace the references to the arrays with the argument provided by the function
	(eg. `canyons[i].posX` becomes `t_canyon.posX`)
	- Finally we need to call these functions passing each canyon or collectable as a
	parameter.
	- You should now see canyons and collectables rendered. HINT: check the draw order is
	correct

6. Implement scrolling [1 marks]
	- Try walking to the edge of the screen and check that all the rendered items
	move in the correct direction to create the illusion of motion.

7. Implement collectables interaction [2 marks]
	- As you did with the `drawCollectable` function, replace the references to `collectable`
	with references to `t_collectable`.
	- Write the code to call `checkCollectables` just below the call to `drawCollectables`. It
	should use exactly the same format.
	- We now need to make sure that the collectable is not drawn once it has been found. Add
	a conditional statement to the same `for loop` which prevents both functions being called
	if that collectable's `isFound` property is `true`
	- Test your code to check that collectables disappear when the game character collides with
	them.
	- You'll notice that once the screen starts scrolling the collectable items stop functioning
	as expected. This is because `gameChar_x` only represents where the character appears
	on the screen not where they are in the game world.
	- The variable `gameChar_world_x` shows where the game character is in the game world. Replace
	`gameChar_x` in the `checkCollectable` function with `gameChar_world_x` to make the collectable items work with scrolling.

8. Implement canyons interaction 
	character plummet into the `draw` function.
	- Adapt the code to use the argument `t_canyon`
	- Adapt the same code to use `gameChar_world_x` instead of `gameChar_x`
	- Call the function from the same `for loop` which draws the canyons, passing the each canyon
	as an argument in the same way as you did for `drawCanyon`
